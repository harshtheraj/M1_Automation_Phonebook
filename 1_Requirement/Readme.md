## Introduction

This mini project in C Phonebook allows you to perform simple Phonebook operations like in your mobile. You can add, list, modify, search and delete Phonebook-related records. File handling and data structure concepts has been extensively used for almost all functions in this mini project
## RESEARCH

## Features
- The Playfair cipher uses a 5Ã—5 grid of letters, and encrypts a message by breaking the text into pairs of letters and swapping them according to their positions in a rectangle within that grid: 
- In playfair cipher unlike traditional cipher we encrypt a pair of alphabets(digraphs) instead of a single alphabet.
## State of Art
yet not done

# SWOT ANALYSIS

## Strengths
- It can store large numbers of contact list.
- In what format do you want you can write to save thier name. 
- The contact list will save forever in your device.  
- It can use special characters and numbers for saving a contact.

## Weaknesses
- It considers only 15 letters for one person at a time. 
- Only one person can at single time.  
- Anyone can save any conatct through your device.
- It cannot use special characters and numbers.
## Opportunities
- it will be able to encrypt plain text of any natural language.
# 4W and 1H
## What
- The Playfair cipher was the first practical digraph substitution cipher.it will be able to encrypt plain text of any natural language.In playfair cipher unlike traditional       cipher we encrypt a pair of alphabets(digraphs) instead of a single alphabet.
## Why
- Playfair cipher is the first and best-known digraph substitution cipher, which uses the technique of symmetry encryption, and if anyone need secreat conversation on that time 
  playfair can be use.

## Where
- When the two or more than two person aur want to talk privately on that time this technique is used. 
- This technique is not used for business purpose because this technique is easily decrypted when anyone have idea about this Technique.  
## How
- First of all identify the number of characters in the language.
- Identify the  size  of  the  generalized  matrix. 
- Create Diagraphs.
- Build  mapping  of  the  characters  with  the Unicode.
- Fill all the cells  of  the generalized matrix  with the characters.
- Select a key and perform the encryption.
